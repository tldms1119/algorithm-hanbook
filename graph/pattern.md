## Graph Pattern

### 📌 When to Use
- Prerequisite relationships
- Dependency ordering
- Detect cycle in directed graph
- Scheduling problems

### 🧠 Use cases
1. Topological Sort
   - BFS (Kahn's Algorithm) - using indegree (level order traversal)
     ```
     1) Build adjacency list
     2) Compute indegree array
     3) Add nodes with indegree 0 to queue
     4) Process queue:
       - Remove first node from queue
       - Reduce indegree of neighbors
       - If neighbor indegree becomes 0, add to queue
     5) If processed count == total nodes → no cycle
     ```
   - DFS (Cycle detection with visited states)

### ⏱ Typical Complexity
- Time: O(V + E)
- Space: O(V + E)
